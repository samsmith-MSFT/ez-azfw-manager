# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2026-11-11

### Fixed

- Rules page headings, metadata, search and actions now wrap to fit the available pane width instead of overlapping when either sidebar is open.
- Rules tables keep readable column widths and scroll horizontally in smaller windows instead of collapsing Source and Destination into Service and Action.
- Windows builds now use **EZ AzFW Manager.exe** consistently for the packaged executable and installer launch target, with **EZ AzFW Manager** as the default fresh-install folder name. Public download filenames and the existing installer identity remain unchanged; upgrades can retain previously selected installation folders.
- Windows distribution builds fail before creating an installer if the expected packaged executable is missing.
- Updated Azure Identity to 4.14.1, removing the older nested MSAL dependency and resolving the two high-severity production dependency audit findings.

### Changed

- Updated Vitest to 5.1.0 and the React Vite plugin to 6.2.1.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-11-11

### Added

- **IP group management.** A new IP groups page lists groups across accessible subscriptions with name, subscription, resource group, location and tag filters. View member addresses and create groups with validated names, IPv4 addresses, CIDRs and ranges. Creation writes directly to Azure and is separate from rule drafts.
- **Bulk CSV rule import.** Download a template with network, application, DNAT and IP group examples, then preview and stage rules across collection groups and collections in the selected policy. Validation reports CSV line numbers and requires full Azure resource IDs for IP groups.
- **Import conflict review.** Review same-name rules, duplicates and potential traffic overlaps before staging. Choose Skip, Replace existing rule or Import anyway where applicable; reviewed conflicts are rechecked before the whole import is staged.
- **Policy threat intelligence.** Managed policy rows now offer Off / Alert / Deny buttons using the existing save, review and commit workflow. Inherited-only parents remain read-only, with Basic-tier and parent-policy restrictions validated.
- **Advanced firewall settings.** View learned SNAT prefixes, associate an existing Route Server, configure supported scaling limits, and assign or remove existing maintenance configurations.
- **Advanced policy settings.** Configure DNS proxy/custom DNS, validated threat-intelligence IP and FQDN allowlists, SNAT auto-learning, and Premium TLS inspection using existing Key Vault certificate secret references and user-assigned managed identities.
- **Firewall start and stop.** Stage power changes from the State column, review disruption warnings, then commit. Original network allocation references are saved before stopping and reused when starting; existing resources can be selected when a saved allocation is unavailable.

### Changed

- Renamed the app to **EZ AzFW Manager** and the repository to **ez-azfw-manager**. Release downloads and executable names now use `ez-azfw-manager`; existing saved-data paths, preferences, shared-storage discovery tags and installer identity are retained for compatibility.
- Firewall and policy state controls use grouped buttons instead of sliders. Firewall buttons show Stop / Running or Stopped / Start based on live Azure state, while pending choices remain amber.
- Shared filter controls have squared-off corners, and IP group creation uses the same searchable dropdown style as firewall deployment.
- Commit review, progress, shared history and interrupted-operation verification now support firewall and policy settings alongside rule changes. Policy snapshots can capture and restore advanced settings.
- Firewall private-IP display uses fresh ARM configuration rather than potentially delayed discovery data after allocation changes.

### Fixed

- Firewall writes no longer send the firewall ETag as `If-Match`, which Azure's allocator can compare with the linked subnet ETag and fail with `PreconditionFailedEtagMismatch`. Fresh-state field conflict checks remain; avoid concurrent external firewall edits while committing.
- Azure operation failures retain error codes and nested details. Accepted requests are not reported as completed, and terminally failed operations are not automatically resubmitted.
- Policy mode and advanced setting edits preserve each other and use a single policy update when committed together. Firewall power edits preserve unrelated pending settings and maintenance assignments.
- Persistence failures now block commits and deallocation instead of reporting success or losing restart references. Maintenance assignment changes are rechecked after long-running firewall updates.

### Important

- Start/stop interrupts traffic; restart can change the private IP or fail because of regional capacity. Retained public IPs and other resources can continue to incur charges while the firewall is stopped.
- TLS inspection and maintenance editing reference existing resources only; the app does not create certificates, identities or maintenance schedules, or grant their permissions. Commit a VNet Route Server association before enabling policy SNAT auto-learning.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- **Windows installer.** Each release now includes an installer (`-setup.exe`) that lets you choose the install folder (`C:\Program Files` by default), with Start menu and desktop shortcuts and an uninstaller, alongside the portable `.exe`. Your data is shared between the two and is kept when you uninstall.

### Changed

- The portable Windows file is now named `ez-azfw-ruleman-<version>-win-<arch>-portable.exe`, to tell it apart from the installer.
- Updated React to 19, TypeScript to 7 and the formatter (oxfmt), and the GitHub Actions used by CI and releases to v7.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- **Shared commit history.** Every commit is saved to the same Azure Blob Storage account as the snapshots, so you and your teammates can see who made what change. It uses its own blob container, which must be different from the snapshot container: the setup form checks this, and the app refuses to save or read history from the snapshot container. Commits that couldn't be saved there still show on the device that made them, marked "This device only".
- The "Rule collection groups" panel on the Rules page can be collapsed to give the rules more room; the app remembers your choice.
- Creating a snapshot storage account now assigns you the **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role on it, with a spinner on the button while it deploys. If you can't create role assignments, a notice on the Snapshots tab tells you to assign yourself that role before you can view snapshots.
- Choosing an existing storage account shows a banner explaining that you need blob data access (Storage Blob Data Contributor) on it.
- **Flow tester web categories.** Azure has no API that maps a site to its web category, so the Flow tester has an optional "Destination web categories" field. Pick the category you found with Web Category Check in the portal and web category rules are matched against it instead of showing as "unsure".

### Changed

- Snapshot blobs are now read and written with your own Azure sign-in (Microsoft Entra ID) instead of storage account keys.
- A commit's snapshot is also saved when the commit finishes after the app was restarted. If saving it fails, the commit is still recorded and you're told the snapshot wasn't saved.
- Committing now checks that you can access snapshot storage before anything is written to Azure.
- The Rules page no longer shows "Committing N changes to Azure…" under the group name; the progress bar at the bottom of the app already shows it.

### Fixed

- Blob access failures now report Azure's error code and say whether the cause is a missing role, storage networking (firewall or disabled public access), or a rejected sign-in, instead of always asking you to assign a role.
- The Snapshots tab failed with a Resource Graph `BadRequest` when listing storage accounts, and kept showing a loading spinner next to the error.
- Errors loading storage configuration, subscriptions, regions or snapshots are now shown instead of an endless spinner, a disabled button, or a misleading "no snapshots" message.
- Snapshot lists now include every page of results, always show each policy's newest snapshot, and skip malformed snapshot files instead of crashing the view.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Firewall policy **Snapshots** tab backed by centralized geo-redundant Azure Blob Storage (`Standard_GRS` with blob soft delete, container soft delete, and blob versioning enabled by default) and tenant-wide auto-discovery.
- Cumulative commit-only policy snapshots that capture the full policy state once per commit, with nested Rule Collection Group → Rule Collection → Rules dropdowns and one-click rollback staging.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-30

### Fixed

- Sign-in failed with AADSTS650057 when another tool had set `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`. The app now reads its own `EZAZFW_CLIENT_ID` and `EZAZFW_TENANT_ID` variables instead of `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-30

### Changed

- Microsoft account sign-in now opens in an app sign-in window with an account picker, instead of the default browser profile. Default-browser sign-in is still available.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-29

Initial public release.

### Added

- Sign-in with a browser (Microsoft Entra ID via MSAL) or an existing Azure CLI session, with directory (tenant) switching.
- Discovery of Azure Firewalls and Firewall Policies across subscriptions using Azure Resource Graph.
- Editing of rule collection groups, rule collections, and DNAT, network, and application rules, with IP Group, service tag, FQDN tag, and web category lookups.
- Draft (candidate) workflow: changes are staged locally and persist across restarts until committed.
- Risk review and per-group diffs before committing, with detection of concurrent changes made in Azure.
- Local commit history.
- Flow tester to find which rule matches a given flow.
- CSV export of rules.
- Wizard to deploy a new Azure Firewall and Firewall Policy.
- Encrypted, OS key store–backed token cache.
- Portable, no-install executables for Windows (x64 and Arm64 `.exe`), macOS (zipped `.app`, arm64 and x64), and Linux (x64 AppImage).
