# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving EZ AzFW Manager!

## Reporting issues

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/samsmith-MSFT/ez-azfw-manager/issues) first.
- Include the app version, your OS, steps to reproduce, and what you expected. Remove subscription IDs, IP addresses, and other sensitive details from screenshots and logs.
- Report security vulnerabilities privately — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development

1. Install Node.js 22 or later, then run `npm ci`.
2. Start the app with `npm start`.
3. Before opening a pull request, run `npm run verify` (lint, type-check, and tests) and make sure it passes.

`npm run dist -- --arch x64` (or `arm64`) builds release artifacts for the current OS into `out/release/`. Windows produces an installer and a portable executable; macOS produces a zip and Linux an AppImage. Use GitHub Actions for the full platform matrix.

Set `EZAZFW_DEVTOOLS=1` to open development tools on startup. To use your own public-client Entra app registration, set `EZAZFW_CLIENT_ID` with a `http://localhost` redirect URI; `EZAZFW_TENANT_ID` can preselect a directory. The app deliberately ignores `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` so other tools' service-principal settings do not override it.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; open an issue first for larger changes.
- Add or update tests in `src/**/*.test.ts` for logic changes, particularly in `src/shared/`.
- Format code with `npm run lint:fix`.
- Add a line under **Unreleased** in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible changes.

## Releasing

1. Add a dated version section to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and run `npm version <version> --no-git-tag-version`.
2. Run `npm run verify` and validate the affected release builds.
3. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v<version>` and `git push origin main v<version>`.

The tag must match `package.json`. The [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds every supported platform into a draft, adds checksums and changelog-based notes, and publishes as Latest only after all builds succeed. Failed builds leave the release in draft; fix the failure and rerun the jobs or dispatch the workflow with the existing tag.

### Optional signing

Signing is opt-in through repository secrets:

| Platform           | Settings                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows            | `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` (base64 PFX), `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`                       |
| macOS              | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (base64 P12), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` |
| macOS notarization | `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                               |

Local builds use `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE`/`WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` and the corresponding Apple environment variables. Never commit signing material or credentials. Public signing and privacy commitments are in the README's [Code signing policy](README.md#code-signing-policy).
